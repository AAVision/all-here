We always face some obstacles while testing the vendor's endpoints from the backend side and even from the front-end team. So we decided to create that tool that will return to you the status code you want. The tool in default runs on port 9876, but you can pass the port you want.

You can get the release: https://github.com/AAVision/all-here/releases/tag/v0.0.1

## Run
```bash
go run . --port 9887
```

## Build 
```bash
go build .
```
